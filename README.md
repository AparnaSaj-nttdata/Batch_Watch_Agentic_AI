# Instructions on Poetry Setup 
To setup poetry if wanted to better manage dependencies & run the following commands in a bash terminal in codespaces

**pip install pipx**

**pipx ensurepath**

There it should be easy to manage and add the needed dependencies for it. 
Keep in mind, don't make major changes to the poetry.lock because it is sensitive.

**It is a difficult file to work with and can be cumbersome to work with all together**
